## Which CI build-time fix, if any, should I make?

A one-line CSS change costs ~25 minutes: `test` ~10 min, then `publish`
~12-17 min, run in series because `publish` needs `[test, ui]`. The `ui` job,
the only one that could have failed on that diff, took 1 minute.

Causes, measured: no cache for `~/.cargo` or `target/` (the only `actions/cache`
in the workflow is for the classifier model, and ARC runners are ephemeral
pods), so Rust compiles cold three times per run — clippy, clippy with
features, then test. The Dockerfile then compiles it a fourth time, in release
mode for arm64, with no dependency layer to survive a source change.

Options:

- **Cache cargo and `target/` in the `test` job.** Biggest win for the least
  risk; warm runs drop to a couple of minutes. Helps every run, Rust or not,
  and restructures nothing.
- **Split the Dockerfile's dependency layer** (cargo-chef or a manifest-only
  pre-build) so a source change recompiles this crate rather than the whole
  tree. Touches the image build every deploy depends on.
- **Skip the Rust job when no Rust changed** (`paths-filter`). A web-only
  commit becomes ~1 min plus the image build. Needs a `needs:` restructure,
  not just a skip: the UI is embedded via `rust-embed`, so the image must
  still be rebuilt.
- **Leave it alone.** 25 minutes is tolerable and the pipeline is understood.

**Decided:** cache cargo and `target/` in the `test` job. The other two remain open.

## Out-of-band access to the DGX Sparks now that wifi is off

Both nodes are ethernet-only: `piwifi` autoconnect set to `no`, the radio
disabled, and `wlP9s9` down on each. That removes the failure mode where a
wired fault silently demotes an inference node to a 2.4 GHz link and it keeps
serving, slowly, with nothing alerting.

It also removes the only network path in. A switch-port or cable fault on
`enP7s7` now means a console or physical trip, on a pair of boxes that already
need a power cycle when they thrash on memory.

Options:

- **Leave it as done — ethernet only, radio off on both.** Matches the request
  exactly. No emergency path.
- **Re-enable the radio on one node with `ipv4.never-default yes`.** Keeps a
  way in if the wired link dies, while the wifi can never install a default
  route, so it cannot silently carry traffic. Half the fleet stays reachable.
- **Re-enable on both with `never-default`.** Emergency path everywhere, same
  no-default-route guarantee, but two hosts hold a second address on the /24
  again.

**Decided:** leave it as done — ethernet only, radio off on both. Recovery from a
wired fault is a console or physical trip, accepted deliberately.
